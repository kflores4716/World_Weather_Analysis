# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview

The analyses provided in this repository are all part of a travel app that will find travel destinations based on the user's weather preferences. The `weather_database` file provided will grab real-time weather data for a little over 500 cities worldwide. Then, the `vacation_search` file will display the weather conditions in those cities along with a hotel recommendation. There is also a `vacation_itinerary` file provided for those looking to visit multiple cities on the same trip. This itinerary file will find driving routes for the users so that they can easily navigate between cities via car. One of the best parts about these files is that they actually generate maps, that way the user has a visual aid to accompany the weather and travel information that the app is providing.
#### Note
Although the files in this repository contain information for randomly selected cities across the world, the code can certainly be refactored to find weather, hotel, and driving information for a specific selection of cities, as long as you have the city coordinates.
